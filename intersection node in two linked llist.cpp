//naive approach:
//we will run two while loops. each node address in outer loop will be checked in inner loop if the both address is same. This is will take O(n * m) time.
//using hashmap: we will store each node either of two loop. then we will treverse other link list to check if there is any same node. time: O(n + m) and space: O(n)
